Codebook
=================
This codebook contains information on the variables in the "tidy.txt" dataset.

Fixed Variables
=================
These variables are deterimined a priori and include 
  -the "id" or identifier of the subject who performed the activity. 
  -"activity" variable which labels the action the subject performed which produced the signals. 
  -These data were merged from a train and test set, but this distinction was removed since it would not be informative.

Feature Selection (Measured Variables)
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Did not include meanfreq estimates because they were not appropriate.

These variables were then averaged for each type of signal, producing 66 mean feature variables.
